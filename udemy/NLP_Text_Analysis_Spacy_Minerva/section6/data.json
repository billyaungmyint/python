But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\n\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend.
